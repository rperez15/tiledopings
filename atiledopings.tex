The performance of plastic scintillator degrades when exposed to radiation. 
In this paper, the reduction in light output  as a function of dose rate
is studied for scintillators

\section{Introduction}
Plastic scintillator has long been an inexpensive way to detect 
charged particles produced in particle physics experiments.  
However, its 
light output decreases with accumulated dose.  
Experiments at future hadron colliders such as the Future Circular Collider at CERN\cite{fcc}
or the SppC in China\cite{sppc} would benefit from an increased understanding
of radiation damage in plastic scintillators.


Plastic consist of a plastic substrate, 
often polystyrene (PS) or polyvinyltoluene (PVT),
into which wavelength 
shifting primary and secondary fluors have been dissolved.
When a charged particle traverses the scintillator, the molecules of the substrate are excited.  
This excitation can be transferred to the primary fluor radiatively in the deep UV at low concentrations or via the F{\"o}rster 
mechanism~\cite{forster} at concentrations above $\approx$ 1\%~\cite{birks}.  
The primary fluor transfers the excitation radiatively to the secondary fluor.  
The visible light by de-excitation of the secondary flour
must traverse the scintillator to reach a photodetector, and can be absorbed by ``color centers'' along its path.


When plastic scintillator is subjected to ionizing radiation,
light self-absorption by the color centers (yellowing) increases when the radicals created during irradiation are unterminated or re-terminate in ways that absorb visible light.
The transfer efficiency of the initial excitation of the polymer to the
dopants combined with the probability of radiative decays for the dopants (``initial light output'') can lessen
when bonds form that absorb in the ultraviolet or that decrease the relevent de-excitation mechanisms.
If the damage is primarily to the initial light output, increasing the concentration 
of the dopants may lessen the light reduction, as there will be an 

In this paper, we present measurements of the light output 
of blue and green scintillator rods 
before and after irradiation for various concentrations of dopants, and
as a function of the material used for the substrate.
The damage is studied for 
for dose rates from \textcolor{red}{xxx to xxx}.


\section{Dose rate effects}

The effect of radiation on plastic scintillator is known to depend
both on dose and dose rate ~\cite{sauli,34504,Wick1991472,289295,173180,173178,Giokaris1993315,gillen,1748-0221-11-10-T10004}.  

Two well-studied~\cite{clough1,bolland1,bolland2,bateman,cunliffe,Wick1991472,Biagtan1996125}
sources of dose rate effects in plastics
involve oxygen.   The penetration depth of oxygen
during irradiation depends on the dose rate.
For PS, the penetration depth goes as~\cite{Wick1991472,cloughPS}.
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
z_0^2=\frac{4 mm^2~ krad/hr}{\dot{d}}
\label{eqn:z0}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
where $\dot{d}$ is the dose rate.
There is an abrupt transition between areas with and without oxygen.  The
oxygen  concentration
in the oxidized regions is almost uniform~\cite{cloughPS}.
For a tile with a thickness of 4 mm, oxygen permeates the entire sample at
a dose rate of 1 krad/hr
For dose rates above this value, the damage to the scintillator
will depend on the dose rate, as peroxides will form in the regions
with oxygen, but will not in the regions without.
The rate of peroxide
formation in the areas containing oxygen can as well~\cite{clough1}.
At low enough dose rate, oxygen permeates the plastic 
and the radicals created during irradiation tend to quickly
form peroxides that absorb in the ultraviolet~\cite{clough1}, 
affecting the initial light output.  
The rate of peroxide formation may depend on the dose rate if the bond formed is bimolecular.
At high enough dose rate, however, the penetration depth for oxygen may
be thinner than the thickness of the plastic, and many short-lived ``temporary'' color centers can form in the oxygen-free regions.  
These color centers anneal after irradiation either by reforming bonds or by forming peroxides when oxygen re-permeates the plastic.
Because of this, dose rate effects might be ameliorated either by increasing the concentration of the dopant to shorten the path length for the ultraviolet light to the primary dopant.


\section{Sample and irradiation details}
The rods were supplied by Eljen Corporation, and
are similar to EJ-200, a blue scintillator, and EJ-260, a green one, using either
PS or PVT as the substrate.
They are rectangular, with dimensions of 1x1x5~$\rm{cm^3}$, 
and the edges were diamond milled.
The concentration of the primary dopant and the secondary dopant
was 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 times the nominal concentration.
Fig.~\ref{fig:fg} [left] shows a photograph of some of the rods.

High dose rate irradiations \textcolor{red}{( xxx--xxx~krad/hr)}
were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, using their Cobalt-60 (Co-60) source.  Intermediate dose rate irradiations (\textcolor{red}{xxx--xxx~krad/hr}) were performed at Goddard Space Flight Center's Co-60 source.  Very low dose rate were measured using the GIF++ facility\cite{gif} at CERN.  The source is \textcolor{red}{Cs-137?} and the dose rate \textcolor{red}{xxx~krad/hr}.

\section{Measurement technique}
The light output from the rods is measured before and after
irradiation using an alpha source, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hd} [right].
Before measurement, the rods were allowed to anneal
at least 2 months,  until all the temporary damage was gone.
The rod is placed on a Hamamatsu \textcolor{red}{RXXX} PMT, and the
source is placed on the rod.  An alignment jig ensures reproducibility
of the alignment of the three pieces.  The measurements were made using
a \textcolor{red}{textronics scope XXXXX}, with a charge integration
window of \textcolor{red}{xx$\mu s$}.
A typical output spectrum is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hd} [right].
The distribution is fit to a Gaussian near the peak, and its mean is used as a measure of the light yield.  The uncertainty in the light output is taken as the variation in this mean for measurements taken at different times, and after removing and replacing the rod from the jig, and is
\textcolor{red}{$\pm 2$\%}.

The amount of radiation damage is quantified 
using $D$ defined in Equation~\ref{eqn:exp}.
\begin{equation}
\frac{L(d)}{L_0}=\exp{-d/D}
\label{eqn:exp}
\end{equation}
where $L(d)$ is the measured light output after a dose $d$, $L_0$ is the measured initial light
output, and $D$ is the exponential dose constant from the fit.
