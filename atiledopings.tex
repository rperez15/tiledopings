\begin{abstract}
The performance of plastic scintillator degrades when exposed to radiation. We present results on degradation of the light output of scintillator
tiles when irradiated by a $\rm{^{60}Co}$ source for a variety of concentrations of the primary and secondary dopant.  Tiles made from a blue scintillator with blue-to-green wavelength shifting fiber and for green scintillator with green-to-orange wavelength shifting fiber are presented.

\section{Introduction}
Sampling calorimeters using plastic scintillator tiles
with wavelength-shifting (WLS) fibers as the active element
have been part of hadron
collider experiments since the mid 1990's, when the CDF plug
calorimeter was constructed\cite{Aota1995557}.  Both the CMS
Barrel\cite{CMSHB} and Endcap\cite{HCALTDR1997} calorimeters use a similar design.
Prolonged exposure of plastic scintillator to
ionizing radiation, however, can result in damage:
light self-absorption (yellowing) increases and
the transfer efficiency of the initial excitation of the polymer to the
dopants combined with the probability of radiative decays for the dopants (``initial light output'') can lessen.  
During running of the LHC from its commissioning through 2012, the CMS
detector was exposed to an integrated luminosity of 25 ${\rm fb^{-1}}$.  Parts of the
CMS endcap calorimeter are estimated to have received doses of 0.1 to 0.2 Mrad\cite{ecfa2015}.
Exposures prior to installation
using an electron linac and ${\rm ^{60}Co}$ sources
indicated radiation causes a expoential reduction in light
light output with accumulated dose, with a expoential constant of 
around 7 Mrad \cite{vasken}.  However, although the dose received was
small compared to this number,
significant light loss was observed \cite{phaseiitdr}.


The effect of radiation on plastic scintillator is known to depend
both on dose and dose rate.
